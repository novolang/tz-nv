"""Read the emitted LLVM for tz-nv's allocation probe and say
whether any function in `tzrule` can put a cell on
the heap.

Run by tests/alloc_scan.sh three times: once on the package as it
stands, and twice on copies with an allocation spliced into `tzrule`.
Those two copies are what the scan and the compiler respectively have to
catch, because a check that cannot fail is not a check.

The IR is emitted at `--opt=0` on purpose.  At the default optimisation
level the whole probe inlines into `novo_main`, there is no function
left to attribute an allocation to, and the scan would pass over an
empty file.

# The four in BOXERS allocate inside the runtime, so a search for the
# first kind alone would call a per-character boxing loop
